# One-Sample-t-Test-in-R-Testing-Population-Mean
This R script performs a one-sample t-test to evaluate whether a sample's mean differs significantly from a specified population mean (μ = 50). After generating a numeric dataset, the code tests the null hypothesis using t.test(), extracts key outputs—p-value, confidence interval, and sample mean—and prints them for interpretation.
In this Code,
Hypothesis Setup:
H₀: Mean = 50
H₁: Mean ≠ 50
Data Generation: A sample of 10 values is manually defined with a fixed seed for reproducibility.
Statistical Test: t.test(data, mn = 50) runs a one-sample t-test to compare the sample mean to 50.
Result Extraction: summary(data) shows basic stats.
print(test_result) displays test statistics, degrees of freedom, and p-value.
Extracts: mean_estimate: The observed sample mean
p_value: Used to assess significance
confidence_interval: Range where the true mean likely falls
Output Display:Results printed using cat() make it easy to interpret the outcome visually.
