# One-Sample-t-Test-in-R-Testing-Population-Mean
This R script performs a one-sample t-test to evaluate whether a sample's mean differs significantly from a specified population mean (μ = 50). After generating a numeric dataset, the code tests the null hypothesis using t.test(), extracts key outputs—p-value, confidence interval, and sample mean—and prints them for interpretation.
